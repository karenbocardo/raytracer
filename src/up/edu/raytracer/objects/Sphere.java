     * It returns the Intersection between the Sphere and the thrown Ray by the Camera. To get it, it first initializes
     * the distance with a negative value (-1), because in case sthat it is behind the Ray, the Intersection is
     * not rendered; normal and position vectors are as well first defined with generic values. Then, the direction
     * between the Sphere and the Ray is calculated with the standard subtraction; the two intersections of the Ray
     * are also computed here: the first one, with the dot product between Ray and Sphere's directions; second one
     * is the Ray-Sphere direction magnitude squared.
     *
     * After all needed values are obtained, Interection calculation uses Pythagoras theorem. If intersection is
     * negative it is not valid so the return is null. If not, distance, position and normal is calculated. The distance
     * is the minimum between the two intersections (the closest). The position is the addition of the Ray origin
     * and the scalar multiplication of the Ray's direction and the distance. Finally, the normal is the normalized
     * substraction of the Intersection's position and the 3D Object position.

     * @return Intersection between Sphere and Ray
