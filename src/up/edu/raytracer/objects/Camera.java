     * This method calculates, from the Camera, all the positions to the ray that the camera throws. It uses polar

     * calculations. To set a standard measurement, it defines a maximum angle for both horizontal and vertical
     * field of view by subtracting to 90 degrees the half of the corresponding field of view, as well as a maximum
     * radius obtained from dividing <i>z</i> component value (that is the distance between the camera and the array
     * of pixels, over the maximum angle cosine (which represents the maximum distance between the ray to the center
     * of the field of view). Also, the maximum for <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> is gotten by the maximum angle sine times
     * the radius (in the case of <i>x</i> this is a negative value).
     *
     * The size of the two-dimensional array to return is defined by the Camera's resolution; it is where positions
     * are saved. Position in <i>x</i> is obtained by adding to the minimum the division of the range (maximum minus
     * minimum) over the resolution, all that, times the pixel <i>x</i> in the array. On the other hand, position in
     * <i>y</i> comes from subtracting to the maximum the division of the range over the resolution height, all of
     * that times the pixel <i>y</i> in the array.
     *
     * Finally the position is assigned to the pixel as a 3D Vector with all the positions as components (<i>z</i>
     * is always the default value).
